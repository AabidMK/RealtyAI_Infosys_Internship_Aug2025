### RealtyAI – Smart Real Estate Insight Platform

### Overview

RealtyAI is an AI-driven real estate analytics and price prediction system designed to assist property buyers, investors, and urban planners in making informed decisions. 
The platform leverages machine learning, data analytics, and time series forecasting to predict housing prices, identify market trends, and provide valuable insights into regional real estate patterns.

### Key Features

1.Price Prediction: Predict house prices based on location, property features, and market conditions using regression models.

2.Data Visualization: Interactive visual insights through graphs and heatmaps to understand property and market dynamics.

3.Time Series Forecasting: Uses Prophet to forecast future housing price trends.

4.Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: Comprehensive preprocessing for better model accuracy.

5.Automated Prediction Pipeline: End-to-end pipeline for seamless model training and inference.


### Technologies Used

1.Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn

2.Tools & Platforms: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Google Colab

4.ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Prophet


### Project Workflow

1.Data Collection and Exploration – Import and analyze real estate datasets.

2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

3.Feature Engineering – Create meaningful variables (e.g., price per sq.ft, age of property).

4.Model Development – Train and evaluate multiple regression models.

5.Forecasting – Apply time series models for trend prediction.

6.Model Evaluation – Compare models using RMSE, R², and accuracy metrics.


### Future Enhancements

1.Integrate Streamlit or Flask for a real-time web interface.

2.Add geo-spatial analysis using Folium or Plotly.

3.Incorporate external factors like interest rates, inflation, and demographics.

4.Deploy the model using AWS or Azure Cloud for scalability

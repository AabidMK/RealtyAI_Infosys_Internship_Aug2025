### 1. **House Price Prediction**
This folder contains the pipeline for predicting house prices using a Bagging Regressor model. Key files include:
- **`Bagging_Regressor_Pipeline.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model.
- **`feature_engineering.py`**: Contains the `RealEstateFeatureEngineer` class for data preprocessing.
- **`real_estate_inference.py`**: Script for making predictions using the trained pipeline.
- **`Real Estate Data V21.csv`**: Dataset used for training and testing.
- **`real_estate_pipeline_v20250924_122040.joblib`**: Serialized model pipeline.

### 2. **Streamlit**
This folder contains the Streamlit application for interactive real estate price prediction and forecasting. Key files include:
- **`realty_ai.py`**: Main Streamlit app script.
- **`feature_engineering.py`**: Preprocessing utilities for the app.
- **`all_states_prophet_models.pkl`**: Serialized Prophet models for time series forecasting.
- **`real_estate_pipeline_v20250924_122040.joblib`**: Serialized price prediction pipeline.

### 3. **TimeSeries Forecast**
This folder focuses on time series forecasting for real estate prices. Key files include:
- **`realty_ai.py`**: Script for forecasting real estate trends.
- **`feature_engineering.py`**: Preprocessing utilities for time series data.
- **`all_states_prophet_models.pkl`**: Serialized Prophet models for forecasting.
- **`State_time_series.csv`**: Dataset for time series analysis.

## Features
- **House Price Prediction**: Predict property prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Forecast future real estate trends using Prophet models.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based app for user-friendly interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishnuvardhan7569/realtyai.git
   cd realtyai
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
